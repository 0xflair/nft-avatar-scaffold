# üßó Deploying the Hard Way

#### 1. Clone this repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/0xflair/nft-collection-scaffold.git
```

#### 2. Create env variables

Copy the `.env.dist` file to a file named `.env`, and then edit it to fill in the details. Enter your Etherscan API key, your Infura Access Key, and the private key of the account which will send the deployment transaction.

#### 3. Create collection configuration

npm run deploy:rinkeby

# Or mainnet
npm run deploy:mainnet
```
